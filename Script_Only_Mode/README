This is an alternative approach I am working on that would use yan, imageMajick, and wget/curl, with timing/updating based on cron.  We'll see if this gets finished before the Qt version - it probably is simpler, and perhaps more portable.  Qt works on all platforms, but DWS currently only lacks linux support.
