# DWS-linux
Defcon Warning System desktop app for linux

This applet uses Qt to generate a icon in the system tray that displays the current defcon status, as determined by [defconwarningsystem]. The update interval, as well as notification preferences, can be set through the icon menu.

Ubuntu 18.04 users may need to install the "TopIconsPlus" extension through Ubuntu Software (the gnome-shell extensions website appears to be broken).
